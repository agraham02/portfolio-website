## Coding Style

-   **Use TypeScript** for all files.
-   **Prefer async/await** for all asynchronous code.
-   **Functional Components** only. Define like:
    ```typescript
    export default function ComponentName() { ... }
    ```
-   Use **arrow functions** for small utilities and callbacks.
-   **Keep code DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): avoid duplication by reusing logic and components.
-   **Split code into small, focused components/functions/sections**: each should do one thing only (Single Responsibility Principle).

## UI & Styling

-   **Tailwind CSS** for all styling. Use utility classes in JSX. Use `@apply` in global CSS for repeated patterns.
-   **shadcn/ui** for accessible, composable UI primitives.
-   **framer-motion** for animation.
-   **clsx** for conditional classNames.
-   Organize components in `/components/ui/` and `/components/layout/`.

## Next.js & React Best Practices

-   Use the **App Router** (`/app` directory) and **React Server Components** where possible.
-   Use **next/image** and **next/font** for optimized images and fonts.
-   Keep a single global CSS file (e.g., `app/globals.css`).
-   Use **semantic HTML** and accessible ARIA attributes.
-   Prefer **server-side data fetching** (e.g., `async` server components, `getServerSideProps`) for dynamic content.
-   Use **React Context** or **Zustand** for state management if needed.
-   Write **small, reusable components**.
-   Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting.

## Recommendations

-   Consider **Radix UI** for advanced accessibility.
-   Use **Jest** or **Vitest** for unit testing.
-   Use **GitHub Copilot** for code suggestions, but always review generated code for correctness and security.

## Industry Standards

-   Keep dependencies up-to-date.
-   Write clear, concise commit messages.
-   Document complex logic with comments and JSDoc.
-   Use environment variables for secrets/configuration.
-   Optimize for performance and accessibility.
