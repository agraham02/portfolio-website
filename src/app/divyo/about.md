Divyo is the smartest, fastest, and most fair way to split bills when you dine out, travel, or share expenses with others. The app uses OCR receipt‑scanning technology—just snap a photo or upload a bill, and Divyo automatically itemizes every charge (food, drinks, tax, fees, tip). Users then tag who had what—whether individual items or shared plates—and Divyo instantly calculates each person’s exact share, including prorated tax and tip, eliminating time‑consuming manual math and awkward “who owes what” conversations.

But Divyo goes further: it saves recurring groups and meals, so your friend‑group or travel crew is just a tap away. It visualizes charges with color‑coded tabs per person, offers transparent breakdowns for accountability, and integrates with payment apps (Venmo, Cash App, etc.) to settle up seamlessly. Plus, users can export reports for easy expense tracking or reimbursement.

Behind the scenes, Divyo tracks spending habits—ideal for split-trip budgets, shared-house expenses, or business lunches. Machine learning refines receipt parsing over time, while privacy-first design ensures sensitive data is encrypted and user‑controlled. The result? A beautiful, intuitive interface that turns bill‑splitting from a chore into a delight—no calculators, no awkwardness, no mistakes.
