## The Hero Section: Grab Their Attention Immediately

(Visual: A high-energy, short video plays on a loop. It shows a group of friends laughing at a dinner table. One person pulls out their phone, snaps a picture of the bill, and the Divyo app interface quickly shows the bill split. Everyone smiles and taps their phones. The whole interaction takes 5 seconds.)

### **Split the Bill, Not the Friendship.**

### **Tired of the Post-Meal Math Problem?**

You had a great time out. Then the bill arrives. Suddenly, you're the designated accountant, trying to decipher who had the extra appetizer and manually calculating tax and tip on your phone's calculator. It's slow, awkward, and someone always feels like they overpaid.

Divyo ends the awkwardness for good. Our powerful OCR technology does the hard work for you, creating a perfectly fair and transparent split every time. No more calculators. No more guesswork. Just fairness and speed.
